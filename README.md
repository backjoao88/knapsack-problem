# Knapsack problem

The knapsack problem is a problem of combinatorial optimization. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

It was developed in 2019 in the Computer Science course.
